Monitoring the Electrical Meter

The big problem is filtering out the sun, which shines directly behind my meter in the afternoon.
I made a light-proof cover for the meter. It has a hinge so the meter-reader can lift it.

I need to work on the mechanics/circuit to filter out the sun. I know it can be done because
the commercial reader device does it.

The Pi reports the number of pulses counted every 10 seconds.
